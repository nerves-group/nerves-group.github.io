# Nerves Remote Meetup

The Nerves remote meetup is held monthly (usually on the last Wednesday of the month.)

## Schedule

The next Meetup is scheduled for Wednesday, September 25, 2019 at 8:00pm MDT (UTC-6). We will post a link to the Google Hangouts on the site when it is available.

The agenda is to have Matt Ludwigs discuss [Grizzly](https://hexdocs.pm/grizzly/readme.html), a new Z-Wave library written for Nerves.
